#what is next

return statments:

x = myfunc(y)

x, z = myFunc(y)

added anywhere there is a return, it needs to know the asigning portion.


# soooo i asign vars always had a check to make sure they are asign the right kind of thing, then that would be good.
# theeeeen if you asign something for the frist time it can maloc bassed on the other objects thing!
